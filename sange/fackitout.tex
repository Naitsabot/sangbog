    Push me up  
    Pull me down  
    Run my code and watch it go
    It'll runnin' circles around you sooner than you know
    A little crash later
    And its flashing blue
    Just kickin' this code but not for revenue
    But I'm alright
\end{vers}
\begin{omkvaed}
    'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done  
    You can't stop now
    You've already begun
    You feel it runnin' through your bones
    And you fack it out  
    And you fack it out
\end{omkvaed}
\begin{vers}
    Stop that 
    Rest your hands
    Can't you hear you type too loud  
    No can't hear nothin' 'cause I got my head up in cloud 
    I bit off a little more than I can chew
    I'm chasing bug up and down the code review
    But that's okay
\end{vers}
\begin{omkvaed}
    'Cause it's easy once you know how it's done

    And you fack it out  
    And you fack it out  
    Oh brother don't you know  
    You really gotta fack it out  
    When you fack it out  
    Oh baby don't you know  
    You really gotta fack it out  
    When you fack it out  
    Oh brother don't you know you  
    You really gotta fack it out
